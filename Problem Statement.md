To address this issue, the project focuses on developing a database system that serves as a comprehensive city guide for travelers. The system should provide accurate and up-to-date information about popular cities, including attractions, accommodations, restaurants, transportation, local events, and safety tips.

By providing a user-friendly and informative city guide, the system aims to enhance travelers' experiences, enable efficient trip planning, and facilitate seamless exploration of cities worldwide.

2. **What is the profit margin?** In the digital services industry, the gross profit margin can be quite high, often over 50%, due to low marginal costs.

3. **How does the customer procure the product or service?** Customers would access the service through a mobile app or website.

7. **How do customers pay?** Customers can pay using online payment methods, such as credit/debit card, PayPal, or other digital wallets. The exact options would depend on the company's payment gateway integration.

This data would help in optimizing the platform, developing new features, and marketing effectively to increase revenue.
9. **How are the products delivered to the customer?** As a digital service, the "product" is delivered virtually. Once the customer creates an account, they can start using the service instantly, and any premium features become available as soon as the customer upgrades their account.
